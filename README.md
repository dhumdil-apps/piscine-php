# PHP Piscine - Day 00


## Exercise 00 : Basics or home

#### Turn-in directory : ex00/
#### Files to turn in : basics.html
#### Allowed functions : n/a
#### Notes : n/a

Note: this first exercise, similar to the next ones, has 2 premises. The first is that you
have watched the introduction video to HTML/CSS, and the second is that you won’t
try to look for a pre-packaged answer for the exercises but will really do your best to
learn HTML.

We will start with something simple. If you can’t do it at first, take a break, go home
and come back when you are feeling better.

### Create a web page that contain the following elements:

1. A pink background (“Pink ? what’s wrong with pink ?”). Be cautious, this is not a random color choice.
2. “Basics” as the navigation tab’s title.
3. A title -so bigger- in white, centered, that contains at least 1 special character.
4. Two images side by side representing online shops.
5. Under each image, a link to the matching website.
6. Under that, a horizontal line that separates the page (no matter the size of the window).
7. Finally, under this line, aligned on the right side of the page, in italic and with a monospace font, the copyright symbol, your login, and the current year. (“© ol 2014”).

Note: this exercise should be consumed with moderation.


## Exercise 01 : Mendeleïev

#### Turn-in directory : ex01/
#### Files to turn in : mendeleiev.html
#### Allowed functions : n/a
#### Notes : n/a

### Create a webpage that represents Dimitri Mendeleïev complete periodic table of the elements (the current version). The constraints are as follows:

1. The page must contain at least one image, but not for the table itself or for a part of it, only for embellishment.
2. It needs color to be pretty.
3. Each box in the periodic table contains in the middle and in BOLD the symbol of the element, and in small its number, as well as it’s atomic weight, respectively in the lower left and top right corners.
4. The information seen in the table must be in a modifiable text, for example during your defense.


## Exercise 02 : Day of the 42

#### Turn-in directory : ex02/
#### Files to turn in : doft.html doft.css resources/
#### Allowed functions : n/a
#### Notes : n/a

Local foreword: “I feel like I could... like I could... like I could... TAKE ON THE WORLD!!”

### Create very precisely and totally identical the page of the fictional game “Day of the 42” of which you have an image below and in the annex. To create this, you have a slew of compulsory images that you must use (no more, no less). Pay attention to all the details, the positioning, the fonts, the colors, the frames... there are also some links and hot links that will direct you to the following sites:

1. The reload.png image whose title is “Start from the beginning” will bounce you to www.disney.com
2. close.gif (“Disconnect”) goes to www.relaischateaux.com.
3. The actions on the left are respectively named “Advance”, “Take”, “Look”, “Use”, “Speak”. The alt/title must use that name
4. In the central image, a zone on the principal chair in the center (the second one from the right) goes to www.ikea.com and the biggest screen, from the back, in the lower right corner goes to www.apple.com.
5. You can choose the object’s titles but they must have one.


## Exercise 03 : The shrunk agent

#### Turn-in directory : ex03/
#### Files to turn in : responsive.html responsive.css
#### Allowed functions : n/a
#### Notes : n/a

### Like most Russians at some paranoid time in History, Dimitri Mendeleïev was an agent. If he wasn’t at the origin of the former important press outfit (TASS agency), however, he too started to shrink in time. His periodic table did as well. Copy your periodic table from the first exercise and make it responsive to the browser resizing. The periodic table must shrink, the fonts as well. Do as you wish but do not listen to the Javascript pros that will say that it can’t be done without it. Stay on CSS and wait for day09 for the JS.


## Exercise 04 : SNCF* Sandwich

#### Turn-in directory : ex04/
#### Files to turn in : menu.html menu.css
#### Allowed functions : n/a
#### Notes : n/a

A train leaves Paris for Lyon, Saturday September 12th 1985, day of a lunar eclipse. It will ride at 216 km/h, the wind blows S/SE at a factor 5, and the temperature outside the train is 13 degree Celsius, and 22°C inside. The sky is cloudy. Another train leaves Lyon for Paris, on the same day at 23:00. It is riding at 224km/h. Which one of these two train will be the furthest away from Paris when they will cross path?

### While you mull over the question, have a SNCF ham and cheese sandwich commonly referred as “Drop-down menu”. You have some ingredients that are authorized, others are forbidden:

1. Ingrédient CSS : OK.
2. Ingrédient HTML : OK.
3. Ingrédient Javascript : NON.
4. Ingrédient autre : NON.

Although the aesthetic is subjective, please create a SNCF sandwich -Drop-down
menu- that will be appetizing -rather nice to look at-.
