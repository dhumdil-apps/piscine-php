### I do not know where I landed. I just woke up, I’m lying in the grass and I see the sky above the treetops. I’m lost. The Book is near me. It could have been worse; I could find myself leaning on my desk appearing suddenly in the middle of a gigantic pool inhabited by a kraken. Fortunately this is not the case. I began to explore around. This world is different. The relation with the surrounding space is very strange. Sometimes we make a single step, but in reality we made of eight. I started to lose the habit of slowing down. Everywhere there were varied combinations of normal space and strange spaces, I decided to set a single normal space. The book seems to dedicate a whole chapter, using the terms ’ ’ and ’\t’, to respectively designate natural spaces and strange spaces.

`
$> ./another_world.php "This sentence contains spaces and some tabulations"
This sentence contains spaces and some tabulations
$> ./another_world.php
$> ./another_world.php " This arg is used " "but not this one"
This arg is used
$>

Note: I have found a kind of rocky promontory. I’m on an island! I d’ not know how
I got there or how I’ll get out of it. But tomorrow is another day.
